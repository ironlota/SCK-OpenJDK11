% - 1 instance of systems -> running a workload -> we need to know at some point X objects
% - and at Y systems -> how many objects ?
% - what is the intersection between X and Y

% e.q =
% - 2 running replicas run workloads -> how many objects that have the same data?

% - we need to know how these 2 objects are equivalent?

% ideas :
% - we need a notion of equivalence
% - we need to apply this notion to all objects

% steps :
% - using JVMTI in the callbacks -> to iterate all objects in Heap
% - for each one of objects we will try to compare to another JVMs
% - we want to check the objects between two objects
% - given two instances -> looking at the content -> are they same?

\begin{itemize}
\item we only share `all pages` not the `real data`
\item how can we be more specific -> to save the real data instead of whole heap?
\item we need to go deeper into `old generation` itself and find the real content
